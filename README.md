## Project description

This is an automated weather application that allows users to log into their mailbox via Gmail OAuth2 and send emails with information about the current weather in a selected city.

## Configuration

The application uses the Google Cloud Gmail API and has not yet been published, so to run it locally, you need to configure your own Gmail API and weather API (from the following website https://openweathermap.org/api).
In addition, you need to create a virtual environment and an .env file that contains the following variables: WEATHER_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, EMAIL_ADDRESS.

## Final result

The recipient will receive the following message in their email inbox.
